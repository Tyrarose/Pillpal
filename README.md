## PillPal: Drug-Drug Interaction App (Prototype)

### Overview
This repository contains a prototype of a Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) app, designed to demonstrate the concept of identifying potential interactions between various drugs. This prototype is created using Android Studio and Kotlin, with randomized data for demonstration purposes.

### Features
- **Search Functionality**: Search for drugs and view randomized interaction results.
- **Interaction Details**: Displays the severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and description of potential interactions.
- **User Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI designed using Android Studio.
- **Randomized Data**: Interaction data is generated randomly and does not reflect real-world drug interactions.

### Contents
- **`/app`**: Contains the Android project files.
  - `MainActivity.kt`: Main activity file for the app.
  - `DrugDetailsFragment.kt`: Fragment for displaying drug details and interactions.
  - `UI/`: XML layout files for the user interface.
- **`/assets`**: Includes randomized drug and interaction data in JSON format.
- **`/documentation`**: Includes a technical guide and usage instructions.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Kotlin plugin for Android Studio

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tyrarose/pillpal.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle files to download dependencies.
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.

### Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Search for drugs by typing in their names.
3. View randomized interaction results, including severity levels and descriptions.
4. Explore the appâ€™s user interface to understand potential interaction workflows.

### Data Disclaimer
This prototype uses **randomized data** purely for demonstration purposes. The interactions and drug details displayed in this app are not based on actual medical information and should not be used for real-world decision-making.

### Future Work
- Integration with real-world drug databases (e.g., FDA, WHO).
- Enhanced search functionality with auto-suggestions.
- User accounts for saving drug lists and tracking interactions.
- Improved UI/UX design for accessibility and ease of use.

### Contributing
Contributions to enhance the prototype are welcome. To contribute:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Commit and push your changes.
4. Open a pull request.
